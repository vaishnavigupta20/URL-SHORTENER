# URL-SHORTENER
I recently built a URL Shortener backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

This project was all about learning how to design and test REST APIs without any frontend—so no HTML or CSS involved. Instead, I used Postman to create, test, and debug all the endpoints.

✨ What it does:

Generates short links for any URL you provide

Saves and retrieves them from MongoDB

Tracks each time someone uses the short link (with timestamps)

Automatically redirects to the original URL

This was a great way to get hands-on experience with backend development, database operations, and API testing.
